# Kovi

A OneBot V11 bot plugin framework developed in Rust.

You can find more documentation in the [Kovi Doc](https://threkork.github.io/kovi-doc/).

The project is currently in beta.

More features will be added in future updates.

**Note⚠️: The project is in Beta, and the following may change.**

**Note⚠️: The project currently only supports the OneBot V11 forward WebSocket protocol.**

The original intent behind this project is to enhance group activity, facilitate group management, and is intended for personal entertainment, learning, and communication purposes only. **No one is allowed to use this project for any illegal activities.**

## Why is it called Kovi?

The bot plugin development method is derived from [Kivi](#). The [Kivi](#) repository is no longer available, but you can check out its author [Viki](https://github.com/vikiboss). If you've developed plugins for the [Kivi](#) framework before, getting started with this framework will be easy.
